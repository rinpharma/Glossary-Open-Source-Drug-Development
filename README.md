{falcon}

The {falcon} initiative is an industry collaborative effort under {pharmaverse} that unites Boehringer Ingelheim, Moderna, Roche, and Sanofi with the aspiration of building and open-sourcing a comprehensive catalog of harmonized tables, listings, and graphs (TLGs) for clinical study reporting. Drawing inspiration from the FDA Standard Safety Tables and Figures Integrated Guide (https://downloads.regulations.gov/FDA-2022-N-1961-0046/attachment_1.pdf), the {falcon} initiative has successfully developed and open-sourced 11 templates to date.
